        <h1>404 - Time to Turn Back</h1>
        <p>I'm going back to 404... If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive,<br>don’t you think it's time to head back to <a href="http://codequestt.rf.gd/">somewhere you belong</a>?</p>
        <p>Oh, did you stumble here by mistake? Well, you’re still “back at 404” <br>— unless, of course, you find <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGMvFJFgOw/qK-aYjb1DHJGsEKYD0bOHw/view?utm_content=DAGMvFJFgOw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor#4" class="hidden-link">another way.</a></p>

        <h2>Oh, while you're at it, here's the lyrics to "505" by Arctic Monkeys</h2>
        <p>I'm going back to 404.</p>
        <p>If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive,</p>
        <p>In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side</p>
        <p>With your hands between your thighs.</p>
        <p>Stop and wait a sec’</p>
        <p>Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?</p>
        <p>I’d probably still adore you with your hands around my neck</p>
        <p>Or I did last time I checked.</p>
        <p>Not shy of a spark,</p>
        <p>A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark.</p>
        <p>Frightened by the bite, though it’s no harsher than the bark,</p>
        <p>The middle of adventure is such a perfect place to start.</p>
        <p>I'm going back to 404.</p>
        <p>If it’s a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive,</p>
        <p>In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side</p>
        <p>With your hands between your thighs.</p>
        <p>But I crumble completely when you cry.</p>
        <p>It seems like once again you’ve had to greet me with goodbye.</p>
        <p>I’m always just about to go and spoil a surprise,</p>
        <p>Take my hands off of your eyes too soon.</p>
        <p>I'm going back to 404.</p>
        <p>If it’s a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive,</p>
        <p>In my imagination, you’re waiting lying on your side</p>
        <p>With your hands between your thighs and a smile.</p>
